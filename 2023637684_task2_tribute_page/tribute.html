        William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American businessman and philanthropist. A pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, he co-founded the software company Microsoft in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen.
        Following the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), Gates became then the youngest ever billionaire in 1987, at age 31. 
        On the 2024 Forbes list, he was ranked the world's seventh wealthiest person, with an estimated net worth of $128 billion.
